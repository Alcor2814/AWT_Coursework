Note: Issues contains volume. Volume is the only way to determine publisher, but this does mean making multiple calls unless info can be used to filter publisher.
	Investigation:
		- site_detail_url: https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wolverine-revenge-red-band-raw-black-and-white-edi/4000-1143331/
		- api_detail_url: https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-165536/
		- Marvel and DC both use 4000/4050 for each url. Not a publisher identifier.
	- Idea:
		- Retrieving the publisher also retrieves every volume associated with them. 
		- Retrieving the most recent issues (filtered by week) retrieves the volume information with it. 
		- Every issue must be compared to the list of volume ids retrieved via the publisher to create a filter.
			- This seems quite costly.
